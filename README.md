# AlphaChip
CHIP-8 interpreter in C++, as a project to learn how to make an emulator.

Uses the [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) for handling input and graphics.

Based directly in [Laurence Muller's tutorial](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).
